# Image_Classification

Development of robust classifiers which can distinguish between images of different types of vegetables, while also correctly labeling images that do not contain any one type of vegetable as noise.

This probelm was attempted in 3 ways:
1) Training a VGG16 model from scratch
2) Fining tuning VGG16 model tranined on Imagenet
3) Fining tuning ResNet50V2 model tranined on Imagenet
